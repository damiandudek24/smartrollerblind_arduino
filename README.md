Code for microcontroller that allow controll roller blind

l project was created based on a microcontroller managing its movement through a stepper motor. The control is done from within the application that allows to choose between two modes. Communication between the application and the microcontroller takes place with the use of a real-time database. With its help, it is possible to control the application outside the place where the window is placed.

This repo shows code using A4988 RepRap stepper motor controller and light sensor to controll smart roller blind
